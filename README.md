# CST391-Milestone
**Goal:**
Design 2 web applications that implement a REST API back-end services using Express and NodeJS.  1 app uses the Angular JS Framework and the other uses the React JS Framework.  A product must be supported that includes at least 3 different data types in the MySQL DB and implement CRUD operations. 

## Milestone 1 
### 2023/12/24 Project Proposal


**Introduction:**

I would like to develop an app that is a guide for all of the movies and shows on streaming services.  It should allow users to search for all known movies and shows and also create a wish list for media that is not currently available.  When the media becomes available, the users will be notified if they have it on their wish list along with what streaming service it is available to watch on.  The product is the _media_. 


**Risks:**

I may not have time in this school project to implement a way to gather all of the media from streaming services.  I don't currently know if each streaming service has a public list of all of their media either.  So, I may resort to hard-coding all of the media to get the app functioning first.  Then toward the end of the project, add the functionality to update live media if I have time.
