<u>**Goal:**</u>
Design 2 web applications that implement a REST API back-end services using Express and NodeJS.  1 app uses the Angular JS Framework and the other uses the React JS Framework.  A product must be supported that includes at least 3 different data types in the MySQL db and implement CRUD operations.

<u>**Introduction:**</u>
I would like to develop an app that is a guide for all of the movies and shows on streaming services.  It should allow users to search for all known movies and shows and also create a wish list for media that is not currently available.  When the media becomes available, the users will be notified if they have it on their wish list along with what streaming service it is available to watch on.  The product is the _media_.
